[![SUBLIMEt](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/Sublime_Text_3_logo.png)](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

## My requirements before choosing an IDE

1. No Microsoft, Adobe, etc.
2. User-friendly interface
3. Cross platform _(at home my partner and I have Linux, Mac and Windows computers, so I want to be able to use the same IDE on all of them)_

## My choice: SUBLIME

* Download link for Linux, Windows & Mac: https://www.sublimetext.com/
* I downloaded SUBLIME from the Linux Software Manager

## PROs

1. The interface
	* The menu is easy to navigate.
	* There seems to be lots of functionalities that might be useful in the future.
	* The interface still looks user-friendly for someone who's just starting.
	* There are lots of shortcuts.

2. The layout
	* It's possible to split the window into up to 4 colums or 3 rows for easy navigation and for comparing different parts of the same file.
	* On the right side, you immediately see where you are in the document, and you can easily scroll up and down to navigate in it.
	* There's a distraction-free mode that hides all ongoing programs as well as the menu bar of the computer
	* There are various themes, including a night mode to rest your eyes.

3. The basic functionalities
	* There's a spell check.
	* It's compatible with many programming languages.
	* There's easy access to frequently-used functionalities.
	* You can create bookmarks within a document.
	* Savings are done automatically.
	* You can make changes in multiple places of a file at the same time.

4. Misc.
	* It's fast _(based on what I read)_ even with large files.
	* It's apparently easily customizable (menu, macros, etc.).

## CONs

1. It's not open-source. 
	* There's a free unregistered version, and a paying one.
	* With the unregistered version, there's a pop-up appearing after a certain number of savings offering to switch to the registered one. 

2. Before installing plug-ins, it's necessary to close SUBLIME.

3. Apparently the debugger is not that good, particularly when programming in Java.

4. There's no preview functionality.

5. There's no synchronization with the cloud.

## My number 1 reason for chosing SUBLIME

As a beginner, I want something **user-friendly** but with enough functionalities to work in a more **advanced mode** as I'll be improving my skillls. 

_Once I have a good command of this IDE and experiment its upsides and downsides, I'll be able to switch to another editor if necessary. Choosing an editor without knowing anything about programming is mostly based on reviews found on the internet and the recommendations from the people I know._
